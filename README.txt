Program that reads in and renders a triangle mesh (of type .obj) to an image via software rasterization. Rasterizes each triangle using barycentric coordinates for linear interpolations and in-triangle test and interpolates color values per pixel using a z-buffer test to resolve depth.
Work is mainly in src main.cpp files
